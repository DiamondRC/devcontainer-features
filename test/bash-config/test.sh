# Feature-specific tests
# The 'check' command comes from the dev-container-features-test-lib. Syntax is...
# check <LABEL> <cmd> [args...]
check "execute command" bash -c "test $HISTFILE == $CONFIG_FOLDER/.bash_eternal_history"
check "ls colors" bash -c "test $LS_OPTIONS == --color=auto"

# Report results
# If any of the checks above exited with a non-zero exit code, the test will fail.
